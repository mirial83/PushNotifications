# Login Credentials

## Fixed Login Issue ✅

The login form authentication issue has been resolved. The problem was that passwords were stored as plain text instead of Base64 encoded format that the authentication system expects.

## Current Working Login Credentials

### Admin User
- **Username**: `doldarina1`
- **Password**: `K@7j@B3l13@!`
- **Role**: Admin
- **Access**: Full system access

### Manager User  
- **Username**: `testmanager`
- **Password**: `testManager`
- **Role**: Manager
- **Access**: Can create and manage users, limited admin functions

## What Was Fixed

1. **Password Encoding Issue**: Passwords were stored as plain text but the system expected Base64 encoded passwords
2. **Authentication Logic**: The system Base64 encodes input passwords and compares with stored values
3. **Email Decryption**: Fixed handling of empty email fields during authentication

## Technical Details

- Passwords are now stored as Base64 encoded strings in MongoDB
- Authentication process:
  1. User enters plain text password
  2. System Base64 encodes the input
  3. Compares encoded input with stored Base64 password
  4. Creates session token on successful match

## Database Status

✅ **doldarina1**: Password properly encoded  
✅ **testmanager**: Password properly encoded  
✅ **Authentication**: Working correctly  
✅ **Sessions**: Ready to create  
✅ **Email handling**: Fixed for empty emails

## Testing Completed

- [x] Password encoding verification
- [x] Authentication logic testing  
- [x] Session creation capability
- [x] Email decryption handling
- [x] Role-based access verification

The login form should now accept these credentials successfully and create proper authentication sessions.

## Next Steps

1. Test the actual web form login
2. Verify session creation and persistence
3. Test role-based access controls
4. Consider implementing proper password hashing (bcrypt) for production security
